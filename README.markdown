Succinct.growlStyle
===================
All the [Growl][] styles out there annoyed me, they were too complicated for
my tastes (in many cases). Bloated, graphically over-abundant, and somewhat
slow.

So, I set out to make one that was as, well… succinct… as possible.

Caveats
-------
- Multi-line growls are currently broken - They appearLike thisWhich is
  annoying.
- This is really ugly if you're not lucky enough to have a copy of
  [Garamond Premier Pro][garamond] sitting around.
